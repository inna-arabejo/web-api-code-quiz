          <h1>Coding Quiz Assessment</h1>
          <p>
            Note: This is a timed coding assessment. The time will start counting down after you click
            the start button. Clicking on a question directs you to the next question. You can not 
            return to previous questions. So answer cautiously! The game is over when the timer 
            reaches 0 or you have answered all the questions. Be sure to save your scores with your 
            initials to keep track of the highest score. Scoring is based on the highest time.
          </p>
          <p>
            *Important: Answering the wrong question will reduce time by 10 seconds.*
