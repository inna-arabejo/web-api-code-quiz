        <p>
          Note: This is a timed coding assessment. The time will start counting down after you click
          the start button. Clicking on a question directs you to the next question. You can not 
          return to previous questions. So answer cautiously! The game is over when the timer 
          reaches 0 or you have answered all the questions. Be sure to save your scores with your 
          initials to keep track of the highest score. Scoring is based on the highest time.
        </p>
        <p>
          *Important: Answering the wrong question will reduce time by 10 seconds.*
